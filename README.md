# Archiving by Design

This Github repository is made for sharing and working on documentation on Archiving by design.

## Documents

We will share documents like white papers, guidelines etc. here once they have been approved for sharing.

## Who owns this?

This repository is owned and maintained by [The European Archives Group](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/service-standards-and-principles/transparency/access-documents/information-and-document-management/archival-policy/european-archives-group_en) (in short, EAG), which is an official European Commission expert group that was established at the beginning of 2006. It is composed of representatives from national archives in EU member countries.

### The Archiving by Design subgroup

The EAG meeting in Helsinki, Finland in September 2019 decided to establish a subgroup for developing Archiving by Design. The subgroup was tasked with addressing a common challenge for European countries - to handle digital born data to ensure that data persists with availability and authenticity over time. The subgroup has developed a white paper and guidelines to elaborate and explore the possibilities of "Archiving by design" (in short, “AbD”) and its relation to information systems, record capture, and submission to the archives. Going forward the subgroup intends to perform pilot studies in several national environments in cooperation with national agencies testing the ideas and requirements. Combining pilots with a theoretical framework can lead to practical methods for working with Archiving by design on a European level, in compliance to a diversity of regulations on a national level.

## Contributing

If there's something you want to ask us or discuss with us, please see if it fits within an existing issue. If not, please post it as a new issue. If you want to contribute to the documents (coming soon) in this area, pull requests are welcome.
