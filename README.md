# Archiving by Design

Archiving by design can be defined as the measures taken during the design or adjustment of information systems to ensure that the information created or handled by the system becomes, and stays, sustainably accessible. The information is sustainable accessible if it is findable, available, readable, interpretable, reliable and future proof. There is not one only way to apply archiving by design, but different methodologies can be used for this purpose. 

This Github repository for Archiving by design is a space made for sharing and working on documentation on the Archiving by design approach and the ways of implementation.

## Documents

We will share documents like white papers, guidelines etc. here once they have been approved for sharing.

## Who owns this?

This repository is owned and maintained by [The European Archives Group](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/service-standards-and-principles/transparency/access-documents/information-and-document-management/archival-policy/european-archives-group_en) (in short, EAG), which is an official European Commission expert group that was established at the beginning of 2006. It is composed of representatives from national archives in EU member countries.

### The Archiving by Design subgroup

The EAG meeting in Helsinki, Finland in September 2019 decided to establish a subgroup for developing Archiving by Design. The subgroup was tasked with addressing a common challenge for European countries - to handle digital born data to ensure that data persists with availability and authenticity over time. The subgroup has developed a white paper and guidelines to elaborate and explore the possibilities of "Archiving by design" (in short, “AbD”) and its relation to information systems, record capture, and submission to the archives. Going forward the subgroup intends to perform pilot studies in several national environments in cooperation with national agencies testing the ideas and requirements. Combining pilots with a theoretical framework can lead to practical methods for working with Archiving by design on a European level, in compliance to a diversity of regulations on a national level.
